<p>He was a great influence to modernism</p>
<p>Even though was all about that post impressionism</p>

<p>His art showed the urban and rural</p>
<p>But they weren’t murals</p>

<p>His bestie was Gaugin</p>
<p></p>

<p>He loved this girl named Eugenie</p>
<p>But she was kind of a meanie</p>

<p>Then he got rejected</p>
<p>And he felt very disrespected</p>

<p>He expressed his emotion through his art</p> 
<p>Not until later, people thought it was smart</p>
<p>His brother Theo helped him become an artist</p>
<p>With over 900 paintings that he made</p>
<p>For only one he got paid</p>

<p>Lithographs, colors, self portraits, and brushstrokes</p>
<p>His works were nothing close to baroque</p>

<p>He was highly depressed</p>
<p>Overall his art …. No one was impressed</p>

<p>No one cared about him until he died</p>
<p>When he committed suicide</p>

<p>He only had one ear</p>
<p>SO he could barely hear</p>

<p>His last words were very clever</p>
<p>He said: Sadness will last forever</p>
